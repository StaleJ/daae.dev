            description: "My main focus here has been batch jobs. We have converted most of the batch jobs from .NET framework to .NET Core. The hardest part of this was to take code out of a mono-repository and making all the batches independent console applications. Another challenge we spent a lot of time on was to make all things integrate correctly with each other (Windows Services, REST APIs, Splunk, databases, ...). We also cleaned up a lot of old code, set up new logging routines and new build and deploy procedures. I have gotten a lot of experience from monitoring applications in production enviroments and fixing things that fails in production. Otherwise, I have done developing of new batch jobs and some web development in React.",
